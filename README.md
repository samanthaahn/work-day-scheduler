When you enter the main page, you'll see a demo of what the quiz will look like. Once you press "start quiz" the timer will begin to count down from 100 seconds. For each question you get wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted. Once you finish the quiz, you can enter your initials and submit your score and it will be entered into the high score section.
