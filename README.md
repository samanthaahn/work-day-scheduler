## Usage
When you start on the day scheduler, you can write in the time slot what you need to accomplish or do for the day. When you click the save button to the right, it will save your tasks so that you won't lose the list if you refresh the page. Colors will highlight the tasks based on hours. So if the task if overdue it's highlighted grey, if the task is current it will be highlighted red, and if the task is in the future, it'll be highlighted green.
